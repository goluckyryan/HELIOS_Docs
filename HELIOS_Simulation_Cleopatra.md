## Overview

Cleopatra is the simulation framework for HELIOS. It has two main components:

| Program | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Cleopatra` | DWBA cross-section calculator  --  wraps `ptolemy` for (d,p), (p,d), (p,p), (d,d) |
| `Transfer` | Monte Carlo simulation of transfer reaction kinematics in HELIOS geometry |

**Workflow:**
```
reactionConfig.txt + detectorGeo.txt + Ex.txt
         ?
  [Cleopatra] -> DWBA.root (thetaCM distributions)
         ?
  [Transfer]  -> transfer.root (kinematic lines + simulated events)
         ?
  Monitors.C / Cali_compareF.C (overlay with data)
```

## `Cleopatra`  --  DWBA Calculator

**Usage:**
```bash
./Cleopatra input_file [angMin angMax [angStep]]
```

**Pipeline:**
1. Reads reaction definition file (similar format to `reactionConfig.txt`)
   - Format: `206Hg(d,p)207Hg(1s1/2 0.000) 10MeV/u AK`
   - Optical potential keywords: `AK`, etc. (see `InFileCreator.h`)
2. Generates Ptolemy input file (`input_file.in`) via `InFileCreator`
3. Runs `./ptolemy < input_file.in > input_file.out`
4. Extracts cross-sections via `ExtractXSec`
5. Saves: `input_file.root`, `input_file.txt`
6. Plots result via `PlotTGraphTObjArray`

**Key binaries:**
- `ptolemy`  --  DWBA code (compiled locally)
- `dwuck4`  --  alternative DWBA code
- `DWInFileCreator`  --  creates Ptolemy input files

**Output:** `DWBA.root` with `pList` TObjArray of TF1 distributions (one per state)

---

## `Transfer`  --  Monte Carlo Simulation

**Usage:**
```bash
./Transfer [reactionConfig.txt detectorGeo.txt Ex.txt DWBA.root transfer.root reaction.dat plot]
```

All arguments are optional  --  defaults to filenames above.

**Key physics in `HELIOS_LIB.h`:**

### `TransferReaction` class
- Reads `reactionConfig.txt` -> sets A(a,b)B
- Uses nuclear masses from `Isotope.h` (AME2016 database: `mass16.txt`, `mass20.txt`)
- Computes relativistic kinematics: boost beta, gamma, CM momentum, Q-value
- `Event(thetaCM, phiCM)` -> generates one event using Lorentz boosts

**Key derived quantities:**
| Variable | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slope` | `299.792 * zb * |B| * beta / (2pi * 1000)` | E-Z slope [MeV/mm] |
| `intercept (y0)` | `?(mb2 + kCM2)/gamma - mb` | E-Z intercept at ground state |
| `alpha` | `slope / beta` | Cyclotron parameter |
| `G` | `alpha * gamma * beta * a` | Geometric factor |

**Inverse mapping `CalExThetaCM(e, z, B, a)`:**
- Given measured (e, z), reconstruct (Ex, thetaCM) using Newton's method
- This is what `Analyzer.C` / `Cali_e_trace.C` use to calculate `Ex` branch

### `HELIOS` class  --  Trajectory Calculator
- `CalArrayHit(Pb, Zb)` -> computes where light recoil hits the silicon array
- `CalRecoilHit(PB, ZB)` -> computes where heavy recoil hits recoil detector
- `DetAcceptance()` -> returns hit code (see below)
- Handles multiple loops (up to 3), blocker, ELUM, extra recoil detectors
- Beam position offset support (xOff, yOff)

**Hit codes from `DetAcceptance()`:**
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| +1 | Light recoil hit array & heavy recoil hit recoil [OK] |
| 0 | No detector hit |
| -1 | Light recoil goes opposite side of array |
| -2 | Light recoil exceeds detector width |
| -3 | Light recoil beyond array range |
| -4 | Light recoil hits blocker |
| -10 | Orbit radius too big (hits bore wall) |
| -11 | Orbit radius too small |
| -12 | Light recoil blocked by recoil detector |
| -13 | More than 3 loops |
| -14 | Heavy recoil misses recoil detector |
| -15 | Cannot find hit on array |
| -20 | Unknown |

### `TargetScattering` class
- Loads SRIM stopping power tables (MeV/mm, keV/um, or MeV/(mg/cm2))
- Integrates energy loss through target depth via Runge-Kutta-like stepping
- Used when `isTargetScattering = true` in `reactionConfig.txt`

### `Decay` class
- Handles sequential decay: B -> d + D (e.g. 1?Ne -> 1?O + alpha)
- Isotropic decay in rest frame of B, boosted to lab
- Activated when `isDecay = true` in `reactionConfig.txt`

## `Transfer` Output: `transfer.root`

> [!!] **`transfer.root` must be generated by the compiled `Cleopatra/Transfer` binary.**
> Do NOT load or `#include Transfer.h` directly in ROOT macros  --  it will not work correctly.
> Always `make` the binary first: `cd ~/digios/analysis/Cleopatra && make`
> Then run: `./Transfer reactionConfig.txt detectorGeo.txt Ex.txt ...`

## E-Z Plot  --  The Key Physics Observable

In HELIOS, the key observable is the **E-Z plot**: detected energy (E) vs z-position along the beam axis.

For each excitation state Ex_i, the kinematic line in E-Z space is approximately:
```
E ~ slope * z + y0_i
```
Where `y0_i = ?(mb2 + kCM_i2)/gamma - mb` depends on Ex_i.

This linear relationship is what makes HELIOS powerful  --  excitation energy is extracted directly from the z-position measurement (via the position-sensitive detectors).

The finite-size correction (`fxList`) accounts for the fact that the detector is at a fixed radius `a` from the beam axis, not at the beam axis.

## Simulation Usage in Calibration

1. **`Cali_compareF.C`** loads `fxList` from `transfer.root` and minimizes the distance between data points and kinematic lines -> energy calibration
2. **`Monitors.C`** overlays `fList` or `fxList` kinematic lines on the E-Z histogram for visual inspection
3. **`Cali_littleTree_trace.C`** creates a compact `temp.root` from data for faster calibration iteration

## Other Cleopatra Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `alpha.C` | Alpha source kinematics for calibration |
| `knockout.C` | Knockout reaction simulation |
| `FindThetaCM` | Given E and Z, find thetaCM |
| `DWBARatio.C` | Compare DWBA cross-section ratios |
| `DWBA_compare.C` | Overlay multiple DWBA calculations -- **dead weight** (not in makefile, superseded; see TODO.md) |
| `nuclear_data.py` | Python nuclear data utility |
| `potentials.h` | Optical model potential parameters |
| `Isotope.h/.C` | Nuclear mass table (AME2016) |

## Notes

- `Transfer` uses `isRedo=true` mode to re-draw events until `hit==1`  --  guarantees all events in tree are detector-accepted (more efficient for statistics)
- Decay simulation is isotropic in the parent rest frame  --  for anisotropic decay, edit `f1` in `Decay` class
- `Knockout` class also exists for knockout reactions (A(a,a'2)B type)  --  not commonly used at HELIOS
- SRIM files must be pre-generated with correct beam/target combination and placed in `SRIM/` subfolder relative to `working/`
- The `reaction.dat` output file contains pre-computed kinematic constants used by `Cali_e_trace.C` for on-the-fly Ex reconstruction
